# Double-Selection-Sort
Min and Max value simultaneous selection sort!
This project began as a simple question to my algorithms professor. When learning about selection sort, and how the choice of
sorting by minimum or maximum values is completely arbitrary, I asked him "well why not do both?"
He liked my initiative and then we began working on this project together. He helped a great deal with designing the algorithm
which is similar to a regular selection sort. However, he left the coding aspect of it entirely up to me. It didn't take long
for me to get this concept down in code. I then designed a presentation, which was given as a lecture to my algorithms class,
and submitted my work as a research abstract for CCSNE Poster Conference 2019. The abstract was selected for presentation!
